# Task 1. Create a Place to Work.

<ol><li>In GitHub, create a new repo for your project - name it streaming-05-smart-smoker ✅ </li>
<li>Add a README.md during the creation process. (If not, you can always add it later.) ✅ </li>
<li>Clone your repo down to your machine.  ✅ </li>
<li>In VS Code, add a .gitignore (use one from an earlier module), start working on the README.md. Create it if you didn't earlier. ✅ </li>
<li>Add the csv data file to your repo.  ✅ </li>
<li>Create a file for your bbq producer. ✅ </li></ol>

# Task 2. Design and Implement Your Producer

<ol><li>Implement your bbq producer. More detailed help provided in links below. </li>
<li>Use the logic, approach, and structure from Module 4, version 2 and version 3.</li>
<<li>These provide a current and solid foundation for streaming analytics - modifying them to serve your purpose IS part of the assignment.</li>
<li>Do not start from scratch - do not search for code - do not use a notebook.</li>
<li>Use comments in the code and repo to explain your work. </li>
<li>Use docstring comments and add your name and date to your README and your code files. </li>
<li>Explain your project in the README. Include prerequisites and how to run your code. </li>
<li>Document your project works - display screenshots of your console and maybe the RabbitMQ console. </li>
<li>If you only have a producer, you won't have a consumer showing messages yet, so you'll need to be creative. We'll build the consumers next. </li></ol>

# Required Approach

<ol><li>Use your Module 4 projects (Version 2 and Version 3) as examples.</li>
<li>Remember: No prior coding experience is required to take this course. Rely heavily on the working examples from earlier modules. </li>
<li>The more similar your code looks to the examples - the more credit earned.</li>
<li>Vastly different approaches can be expected to earn less credit not more.</li>
<li>This project should clearly build on skills and code we've already mastered. If not, let me know and more help will be provided. </li>
<li>The primary difference should be going from 1 to 3 queue_names and from 1 to 3 callbacks. </li>
<li>Part of the challenge is to implement analytics using the tools and approach provided (don't significantly refactor the codebase during your first week of work!) </li>
<li>AFTER earning credit for the assignment, THEN create and share additional custom projects. </li></ol>
