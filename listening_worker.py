    This program actively and continuously listens for messages on three queues, simulating sensor readings from a smart Smoker.
    A message will be received as a struct.  When unpacked, the struct will let us know the queue and the temperature reading.

    Timestamps will be transmitted in the struct, but these will be ignored.  Instead, it will be assumed that the smoker is transmitting data at 30 second intervals.

    Python deques will be used to keep a window of streamed data.  Each time new data is received, it will be added to the relevant deque and then the deque will be reviewed for various issues.  Has the smoker temperature fallen?  Has the temperature stalled on one of the meat thermometers?  These questions will be answered everytime data is received.  If there is an issue, an alert will be generated.

    One consumer will receive messages from multiple queues and handle them with different callback functions.
